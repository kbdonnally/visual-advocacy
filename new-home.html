				<p>Justice, necessarily, starts with engagement.</p>
				<p>Though these notes are taken near-verbatim from spitballing in my notebook, the rough ideas here are nearly formed. In 2018, we're surrounded by examples of people willing to learn about and engage with 'heavy stuff'&mdash;particularly when it a) is digital, mobile-friendly content that b) lets the reader explore the issue at their own pace, and, importantly, c) doesn't attempt to 'dumb things down' for the reader. [Complicated concepts aren't <em>that</em> complicated without the jargon&mdash;if content is visually engaging and speaks to the viewer as an equal (aka both casual and intelligent), Americans flock to it.] This is how we've learned about the Byrd Rule, health insurance pooling strategies, [insert other policy things that a ton of people got engaged with this year]. These efforts [to engage] also made people like disability rights' advocates visible, to some, for the first time.</p>
				<p>So we know the capacity our citizens have to do good, and to enthusiastically learn [esoteric structural concepts] in the process. Now, we must meet people where they are: on their smartphones, tablets, and other devices. Most vital information today is communicated digitally, and this has observable implications for the way that [activism/civil rights/justice stuff/news generally] is spread and viewed. (I'm going into full notes mode, sorry, self.) In a world of clickbait and push notifications, interesting/unusual qualities and small interactions keep readers <em>instinctively</em> attentive to content that they are already <em>intellectually</em> engaged with.</p>
				<p>This looks like [Snowfall - give brief history], other examples. Began around five years ago when the ubiquity of smartphones and developments in [versatility/capability of web design tools] serendipitously collided: site designers could start looking at screens not as paper, made of pixels rather than wood, but as a truly alternative medium. New York Times shifted a lot of their resources towards developing interactive/unusual digital content; [find announcement saying it's basically at readers' behest and they think it's best for business - thus re-proving that people do want to learn and just... pretty and interactive things rock.] [Gives you an excellent choose-your-own adventure quality to exploring content - to linger here or there on a particular interactive element, while others may scroll past, only to be captivated by a graphic mere paragraphs later.] "Snowfall" is probably watershed moment in this approach to content: set a high standard for quality and demonstrated there is an appetite for deep-dive explorations of fairly academic topics.</p>
				<p>Of course, this is nothing new: any movement for human equity in US history has relied on the most emotionally invigorating form of media available at the time, constrained only by the necessity of spreading [their materials] to the national masses at relatively low cost. Example in history of national struggle for Black civil rights/equity: slave narratives (printing cheap, high quality photos don't have words with them yet), "I AM A MAN" signs/march, Ferguson and Black Lives Matter. High-capability smartphones (and other devices) <em>are</em> that Goldilocks of "low cost for high audience" message distribution now: we must meet media where it's at. The "price" for the best shot at widespread civic engagement is lower now than any time in human history: making already-fascinating research/information aesthetically appealing/interesting.</p>
				<!-- Note re. danger: probably put in separate section,
					 is part of "why this matters" -->
				<p>The importance of this is vital, and the relative frivolity attributed to visual [contributions] is a dangerous notion (see: people not being freaked out by Nazis when they wear normal clothes). [insert that visuals are constantly undervalued because aesthetics are viewed as inherently feminine, but we see time and time again over centuries that this is the only way important information sticks deeply so societal change can be wrought.] Scholars trained in both cultural studies and design must apply these skills [in the ways described above], which will boost incredibly important [scholarly work/social justice involving academia, like the ERA movement] into the public discourse. A net social and academic good.<!-- For UVA and the nation! --></p>
